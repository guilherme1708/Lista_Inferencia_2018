## Questão 5

b) Para a função de verossimilhança de $X \sim Beta(1,\theta)$

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = '70%', warning=FALSE}
x <- c(0.61,0.73,0.9,0.11,0.06,0.03,0.6,0.38,0.13,0.1)

theta <- seq(0, 1, length = 100)

n <- length(x)

vero1 <- function(theta) {
  (theta^n * prod(1-x)^(theta-1))
}

plot(vero1, from = 0, to = 5, xlab = expression(theta), ylab = expression(L(theta,x)), main = expression("Função de Verossimilhança"), lwd=2)
points(1.56, vero1(1.56), pch = 19, cex = 1.5)
```

Como podemos observar o máximo ocorre com $\theta \approx 1.56$

Para a função de verossimilhança de $Y \sim Beta (\theta,1)$

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = '70%', warning=FALSE}

y <- c(0.85,0.97,0.41,0.92,0.73,0.66,0.5,0.39,0.5,0.63)

n <- length(y)

theta <- seq(0, 1, length = 100)

vero2 <- function(theta) {
  (theta^n * prod(y)^(theta-1))
}

plot(vero2, from = 0, to = 6, xlab = expression(theta), ylab = expression(L(theta,x)), main = expression("Função de Verossimilhança"), lwd=2)
points(2.13, vero2(2.13), pch = 19, cex = 1.5)

```

Como podemos observar o máximo ocorre com $\theta \approx 2.13$

# Questão 6

Seja x = (0.24, 0.34, 0.23, 0.17, 0.18, 0.14, 0.27, 0.08, 0.20, 0.10, 0.02, 0.22, 0.04, 0.02, 0.03, 0.17, 0.17, 0.08, 0.18, 0.01), Uma Amostra observada.

```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}

x <- c(0.24,0.34,0.23,0.17,0.18,0.14,0.27,0.08,0.20,0.10,0.02,0.22,0.04,0.02,0.03,0.17,0.17,0.08,0.18,0.01)

x_bar <- mean(x)

theta2 <- (1/x_bar)

```

$\bar{X} = \frac{1}{20} \sum_{i=1}^{20} x_{i} =$ `r x_bar`, assim $\theta_{2} = \frac{1}{\bar{x}} = \frac{1}{0.1445}$ = `r theta2`


a) Histograma com os dados da amostra observada:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = '70%', warning=FALSE}
x <- c(0.24,0.34,0.23,0.17,0.18,0.14,0.27,0.08,0.20,0.10,0.02,0.22,0.04,0.02,0.03,0.17,0.17,0.08,0.18,0.01)

x_bar <- mean(x)

theta1 <- 1

theta2 <- (1/x_bar)

theta3 <- 10

n <- length(x)

hist(x, main = "Histograma", xlab = "Dados", ylab = "Densidade", col = "lightgray", breaks = 4)
curve(dexp(x,theta1), add = T, lty = 5)
curve(dexp(x,theta2), add = T, lty = 1)
curve(dexp(x,theta3), add = T, lty = 4)
legend("topright", c(expression(theta[1]==1),expression(theta[2]==6.92),expression(theta[3]==10)), lty = c(5,1,4))

```

b) Gráfico função de Verossimilhança

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = '70%', warning=FALSE}
x <- c(0.24, 0.34, 0.23, 0.17, 0.18, 0.14, 0.27, 0.08, 0.20, 0.10, 0.02, 0.22, 0.04, 0.02, 0.03, 0.17, 0.17, 0.08, 0.18, 0.01)

theta <- seq(0,14, length=2000)

med <- mean(x)

emv_exp <- 1/med

n <- length(x)

lik <- function(theta) {
  theta^n * exp(-theta*sum(x))
}

plot(lik, from = 1, to = 13, xlab = expression(theta), ylab = expression(L(theta,x)), main = expression("Função de Verossimilhança"), lwd=2)
points(emv_exp, lik(emv_exp), pch = 19, cex = 1.5)
points(1, lik(1), pch = 19, cex = 1.5)
points(10, lik(10), pch = 19, cex = 1.5)
